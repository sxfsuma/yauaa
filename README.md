Parsing Useragents
==================
Parsing useragents is considered by many to be a ridiculously hard problem.
The main problems are:

- Although there seems to be a specification, many do not follow it.
- Useragents LIE that they are their competing predecessor with an extra flag.

We're all compatible
====================
The pattern the 'normal' browser builders are following is that they all LIE about the ancestor they are trying to improve upon.

The reason this system (historically) works is because a lot of website builders do a very simple check to see if they can use a specific feature.

    if (useragent.contains("Chrome")) {
       // Use the chrome feature we need.
    }

Some may improve on this an actually check the (major) version that follows.

A good example of this is the Edge browser:

    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36 Edge/12.10136

It says it:

- is Mozilla/5.0
- uses AppleWebKit/537.36
- for "compatibility" the AppleWebKit lie about being "KHTML" and that it is siliar to "Gecko" are also copied
- is Chrome 42
- is Safari 537
- is Edge 12

So any website looking for the word it triggers upon will find it and enable the right features.

How many other analyzers work
=============================
When looking at most implementations of analysing the useragents I see that most implementations are based around
lists of regular expressions.
These are (in the systems I have seen) executed in a specific order to find the first one that matches.

The main problem I see in this solution direction is that the order in which things occur determines if the patterns match or not.

Also regular expressions are notoriously hard to write and debug.

I wanted to see if a completely different approach would work: Can we actually parse these things into a tree and work from there.

Core design idea
================

The parser (ANTLR4 based) will be able to parse a lot of the agents but not all.
Tests have shown that it will parse >99% of all useragents on a large website which is more than 99.99% of the traffic.

Now the ones that it is not able to parse are the ones that have been set manually to a invalid value.
So if that happens we assume you are a hacker.
In all other cases we have matchers that are triggered if a sepcific value is found by the parser.
Such a matcher then tells this class is has found a match for a certain attribute with a certain confidence level (0-10000).
In the end the matcher that has found a match with the highest confidence for a value 'wins'.


High level implementation overview
==================================================
The main concept of this useragent parser is that we have two things:

1. A Parser (ANTLR4) that converts the useragent into a nice tree throught which we can walk along.
2. A collection of matchers.
  - A matcher triggers if a set of patterns is present in the tree.
  - Each pattern is detected by a "matcher action" that triggers and can fill a single attribute.
    If a matcher triggers a set of attributes get set with a value and a confidence level
  - All results from all triggered matchers (and actions) are combined and for each individual attribute the 'highest value' wins.

As a performance optimization we walk along the parsed tree once and fire everything we find into a precomputed hashmap that
points to all the applicable matcher actions. As a consequence

  - the matching is relatively fast even though the number of matchers already runs into the few hundreds.
  - the startup is "slow"
  - the memory footprint is pretty big due to the number of matchers, the size of the hashmap and the cache of the parsed useragents.


Performance
===========
On my i7 system I see a speed of around 4000 useragents per second or <1ms each.
A LRU cache is in place that does over 1M per second if they are in the cache.

In the canonical usecase of analysing clickstream data you will see a 1ms hit per visitor and for all the other clicks
the values are retrieved from this cache at close to 0 time.
